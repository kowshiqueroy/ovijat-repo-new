					<h3>Procurement Procedure</h3>
					<p>Our procurement program is geared towards giving our farmers a ready market for their paddy and at the same time offering them a better return of investments. Company Managing Director Mr. Shamsul Haque does the procurement of paddy in a scientific way with a lot of research work behind it. Before procurement, each and every lot is being thoroughly checked by drawing samples from different areas and is being tested in our hi-tech laboratories for various parameters to ensure that the ready product delivered to our customers, fully satisfies their needs. A special identification code is given to every procured lot for maintaining full traceability of the basmati rice packed in our Ovijat and other brands.</p>

					<h3>Milling</h3>
					<p>Milling is the process wherein the rice grain is transformed into a form suitable for human consumption, therefore, has to be done with utmost care to prevent breakage of the kernel and improve the recovery. Located in Nilphamari, Northern Part of Bangladesh, six hi-tech rice mills of SATAKE Brand of JAPAN produce the best quality of rice with a capacity of 700 metric ton in a day. Each Plant are having facility of producing white rice, steamed rice and parboiled rice with state of art machinery to ensure consistency in every grain. To ensure our commitment to the environment, we also use rice husk (residue of paddy milling) for producing power which partially fulfills our energy requirements.</p>
